/**
 * What is the result of compiling and running this code?
    A. MyException thrown
    B. MyException3 thrown
    C. MyException thrown Done
    D. MyException3 thrown Done
    E. It fails to compile
    
   You can have multiple catch blocks to catch different kinds of exceptions, including exceptions that are subclasses of other exceptions.
   However, the catch clause for more specific exceptions
   (i.e. a SubClassException) should come before the catch clause for more general exceptions ( i.e. a SuperClassException).
   Failure to do so results in a compiler error as the more specific exception is unreachable.

    In this case, catch for MyException3 cannot follow catch for MyException because if MyException3 is thrown,
    it will be caught by the catch clause for MyException. And so, there is no way the catch clause for MyException3 can ever execute.
    And so it becomes an unreachable statement.
    Correct(E)
