/**
   Consider the following code:
   Assuming appropriate import statements and the existence of both the files, what will happen when the program is compiled and run?
   
    A. The program will not compile because it does not handle exceptions correctly.
       ---------
        Remember that most of the I/O operations (such as opening a stream on a file, reading or writing from/to a file)
        throw IOException and this code does not handle IOException.
        FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException and IndexOutOfBoundsException is subclass of RuntimeException.
        The code can be fixed by replacing FileNotFoundException | IndexOutOfBoundsException with IOException
        or by adding another catch block that catches IOException.
    
    B. The program will compile but will throw an exception at run time.
    
    C. The program will not compile because the catch clause is used incorrectly.
         ------
        The catch clause used here is valid. FYI, the exception parameter in a multi-catch clause is implicitly final.
        Thus, unlike in a regular catch block, it cannot be reassigned.
        
    D. It will compile and run without any error or exception
    
    Correct(A)
