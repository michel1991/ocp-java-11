/**
 *  Which classes when inserted into the blank do not allow this code to compile? (Choose two.)
    A. FileNotFoundException
    B. NumberFormatException
    C. Exception
    D. Error
    E. Throwable
    F. RuntimeException
    
   An overriding method cannot declare any new or broader checked exceptions as the overridden method.
   Option A is permitted because FileNotFoundException is a narrower exception than IOException.
   Options B, D, and F are permitted because new unchecked exceptions are allowed.
   Note that IOException is not required to be declared at all in the overriding method.
   Options C and E are incorrect because they are broader checked exceptions than IOException.
   Even if you didnâ€™t know Throwable was checked,
  you should have been able to solve this by process of elimination.
