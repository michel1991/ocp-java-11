/**
  What will the following code print?
    A. It will not compile.
    B. It will throw an exception at runtime.
    C. 800
    D. 200
    E. 400
    
    ---------
    Remember that when a finally clause has a return statement
    then this return statement supersedes any return statement that the try block or the catch blocks might have.

    Now, in this case, when you pass 6 to luckyNumber(int seed), if(seed%2 == 0) throw new Exception("No Even Number Please.");
    is executed and the exception is caught by the catch block where it tries to return 3.
    But since there is a finally block associated with the try/catch block, it is executed before anything is actually returned to the caller.
    Now, since the finally clause has a return statement, this return statement supersedes the return statements of the try or catch blocks.
    Thus, the final return value will be the value returned by the finally block, which is 7.
    In fact, irrespective of whether the try block throws an exception or not, this code will always return 7.
    
    Now, in the switch there is no break statement. So both -
    case 7: amount = amount * 2;
    and
    case 6: amount = amount + amount;
    are executed. so the final amount becomes 400.
     Correct(E)
