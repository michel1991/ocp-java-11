/**
 *  Which exact exception class will the following class throw when compiled and run?
    A. NullPointerException
    B. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
    C. Exception
    D. RuntimeException
    
    
    A NullPointerException never occurs because the index expression must be completely evaluated before
    any part of the indexing operation occurs, and that includes the check as to whether the value of the left-hand operand is null.
    If the array reference expression produces null instead of a reference to an array, then a NullPointerException is thrown at runtime,
    but only after all parts of the array reference expression have been evaluated and only if these evaluations completed normally.
    
    In an array access, the expression to the left of the brackets appears to be fully evaluated before any part
    of the expression within the brackets is evaluated.
    Note that if evaluation of the expression to the left of the brackets completes abruptly,
    no part of the expression within the brackets will appear to have been evaluated.
    
    Here, m1() is called first, which throws Exception and so a is never accessed and NullPointerException is never thrown.
    
    Meaning of "the expression to the left of the brackets appears to be fully evaluated":
    
    Consider this line of code:
    Object o = getArray()[getIndex()];
    (Assume that the method getArray returns an object array and getIndex returns an int)
    
    1. The expression to the left of the brackets is evaluated first. So, first getArray() will be called. This gives the reference to the array.
    It could be null as well. (But if the getArray() method throws an exception, the rest of the statement will not be evaluated i.e.
    getIndex() will not be called.)
    
    2. Now, the expression in the brackets is evaluated, therefore, getIndex() will be called, which will give you the index.
    If getIndex() throws an exception then step 3 will not happen.
    
    3. Finally, the index will be applied on the array (whose reference was returned in step 1).
    At this time, if the array reference is null, you will get a NullPointerException.
    (Correct C)
