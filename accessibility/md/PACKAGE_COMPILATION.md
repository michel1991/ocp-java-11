##### Suppose we have the following class in the file /my/directory/named/A/Bird.java.
#### Which of the answer options replaces INSERT CODE HERE when added independently
#### if we compile from /my/directory? (Choose all that apply.)
```java
    //INSERT CODE HERE
    public class Bird {
    }
```
* A. package my.directory.named.a;
* B. package my.directory.named.A;
* C. package named.a;
* D. package named.A;
* E. package a;
* F. package A;

The package name represents any folders underneath
the current path, which is named.A in this case.
Option B is incorrect because package names are case sensitive,
just like variable names and other identifiers.
