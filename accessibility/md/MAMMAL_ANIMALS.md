#### What is the result of executing the Sounds program?

```java
    // Sheep.java
    package com.mammal;
    
    public class Sheep {
        private void baa() {
            System.out.println("baa!");
        }
        private void speak() {
            baa();
        }
    }
    
    // Sounds.java
    package com.animals;
    import com.mammal.Sheep;
    
    public class Sounds {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            var sheep = new Sheep();
            sheep.speak();
        }
    }
```
* A. The code runs and prints baa!.
* B. The Sheep class does not compile.
* C. The Sounds class does not compile.
* D. Neither class compiles.

The speak() method has private access,
which does not allow code outside the class to call it.
Therefore, option C is the answer.
