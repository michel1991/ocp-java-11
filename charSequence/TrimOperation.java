        The trim() method returns a String with all leading and trailing white space removed.
        In this question, thatâ€™s the seven-character String: ":) - (:".
        Options A and B are incorrect because they do not remove the first blank space in happy.
        Option D is incorrect because it does not remove the last character in happy.
        Therefore, option C is correct.
