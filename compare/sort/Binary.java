  What is the result of the following when called as java Binary.java?
    A. []
    B. [0, 01, 1, 10]
    C. [0, 01, 10, 1]
    D. [0, 1, 01, 10]
    E. The code does not compile.
    F. The code compiles but throws an exception at runtime.
 
  While no arguments are passed from the command line, this doesnâ€™t matter because
  the main() method redefines the args array.
  Remember that String values sort alphabetically rather than by number.
  Therefore, 01 sorts before 1, and option B is correct.
