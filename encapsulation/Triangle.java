/**
 *  Given:
   The above class needs to protect an invariant on the "area" field.
   Which three members must have the public access modifiers removed to ensure that the invariant is maintained?
   
    A. the base field
    B. the height field
    C. the area field
    D. the Triangle constructor
    E. the setBase method
    F. the setHeight method

   -----------
   An invariant means a certain condition that constrains the state stored in the object.
   For example, in this case the value of the area field of the Triangle must always be consistent with its base and height fields.
   Thus, it should never have a value that is different from base*height/2.

    If you allow other classes to directly change the value of base, height, or area, using direct field access,
    the area field may not contain the correct area thereby breaking the invariant.
    
    To prevent this inconsistency from happening, you need to prohibit changing the instance fields directly
    and instead permit the changes only through the setter method because these methods call the updateArea method and keep
    the area and base and height consistent.
