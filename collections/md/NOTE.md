### before answer
* checking declaration of the interface at left
* checking implementation of the interface at right
* checking very well declaration  of the interface at left , it can hold some method, who are hide event we use implementation at the right
* checking correct return of the method (for exmaple  entrySet)
* checking immutability
* checking type generic at the fleft that must match to type generic of the right (without using unbounded, upper, lower wildcard generic)
* checking autoboxing/unboxing
* Checking order of comparing of letters (number, upper case, lower case)
* don't forget sort with TreeSet, TreeMap(key are sort, values sort according to the key sort)
* without unbound, upper, lower bound  the same type is used on both sides of the declaration.
