#### Which of the following use generics and compile without warnings? (Choose two.)
* A. List<String> a = new ArrayList();
* B. List<> b = new ArrayList();
* C. List<String> c = new ArrayList<>();
* D. List<> d = new ArrayList<>();
* E. List<String> e = new ArrayList<String>();
* F. List<> f = new ArrayList<String>();

The diamond operator, <>, is only allowed to be used when instantiating rather than declaring.
In other words, it canâ€™t go on the left side of the equals (=) sign.
Therefore, options B, D, and F are incorrect. The remaining three options compile.
However, option A produces a warning because generics are not used on the right side of the assignment operator.
Therefore, options C and E are correct.
Option C is preferred over option E, since it uses the diamond operator rather than specifying a redundant type.

#### Which statement is true about the following figure while ensuring the code continues to compile? (Choose two.)
[image](images/generics_P_R_Q_S.png)
* A. <> can be inserted at positions P and R without making any other changes.
* B. <> can be inserted at positions Q and S without making any other changes.
* C. <> can be inserted at all four positions.
* D. Both variables point to an ArrayList<String>.
* E. Only one variable points to an ArrayList<String>.
* F. Neither variable points to an ArrayList<String>.

The <> is known as the diamond operator. Here,
it works as a shortcut to avoid repeating the generic type twice for the same declaration.
On the right side of the expression, this is a handy shortcut.
Java still needs the type on the left side, so there is something to infer.
Positions Q and S are on the right side, making option B correct.
In this question, the generic type is never specified, so it is Object. Since it is not String, option F is correct.


#### Code that uses generic collection classes can interoperate with code that uses raw collections classes because of?
* A. type erasure
    Type erasure means that a compiled java class does not contain any of the generic information that is present in the java file.
    In other words, the compiler removes the generic information from a java class when it compile it into byte code. For example,
    List<String> list; and List list; are compiled to the same byte code. Therefore, at run time,
    it does not matter whether you've used generic classes or not and this allows both kinds of classes
    to interoperate because they are essentially the same class to the JVM.
    Type erasure ensures that no new classes are created for parameterized types; consequently, generics incur no runtime overhead.

* B. reification
    This is just the opposite of type erasure. Here, all the type information is preserved in the byte code.
    In Java, arrays are reified. For example,
```java
ArrayList[] alArray = new ArrayList[1];
Collection[] cArray = alArray;
cArray[0] = new HashSet();
```

    The above code will compile fine. But it will throw an java.lang.ArrayStoreException
    at run time because the byte code contains the information that cArray actually
    points to an array of ArrayLists and not of HashSets.

* C. just in time compilation
* D. byte code instrumentation

(correct A)
