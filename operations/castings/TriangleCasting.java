   Questions:
     You have a task to calculate the length of a side of a triangle using the Pythagorean
     theorem and the area of a triangle. Luckily, you are given the formulas.
     For the Pythagorean theorem, you need the square root (one half power) of a2 + b2.
     For the area, you need half of the base times the height. Fill in the blanks to
     implement these algorithms (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Math.pow(Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2), 1/2)
        B. Math.pow(Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2), .5)
        C. Math.squareRoot(Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2))
        D. (1/2) * (base*height)
        E. ((double)1/2) * (base*height)
        F. (double) (1/2) * (base*height)
        G. None of the above

     Option C is incorrect because there is no method named squareRoot.
    There is a sqrt() method; however, you arenâ€™t expected to know it for the exam.
    Options A and D are incorrect because they do not cast to double. 1/2 is integer division, which results in 0 rather than one half.
    Option F is incorrect for the same reason. The cast occurs after all the math has already been done.
    By contrast, option E is correct because the cast to double occurs on the number 1.
    Therefore, dividing by 2 properly results in one half. Options B and E correctly represent the formulas described in the question.
