### Given the following Venn diagram and the boolean variables, apples,
### oranges, and bananas, which expression most
### closely represents the filled-in region of the diagram?

[image](images/apples_oranges_bananas_filled.jpg)
* A. apples && oranges && !bananas
* B. orange || (oranges && !bananas)
* C. (apples || bananas) && oranges
* D. oranges && apples
* E. (apples || oranges) && !bananas
* F. apples ^ oranges

The diagram represents all cases where apples or oranges is true,
but bananas is false, making option E correct.
Option A is close but is correct only
if the top overlapping portion of apples and oranges was filled in.
For fun, you should try to draw the diagrams that would represent the other answers.
