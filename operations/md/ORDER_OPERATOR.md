##### Which of the following operators are ranked in increasing
##### or the same order of precedence? Assume the + operator
##### is binary addition, not the unary form. (Choose all that apply.)
* A. +, *, %, --
* B. ++, (int), *
* C. =, ==, !
* D. (short), =, !, *
* E. *, /, %, +, ==
* F. !, ||, &
* G. ^, +, =, +=

Options A and C show operators in increasing or the same order of precedence.
Options B and E are in decreasing or the same order of precedence.
Options D, F, and G are in neither increasing or decreasing order of precedence.
In option D, the assignment operator (=) is between two unary operators,
with the multiplication operator (*) incorrectly having the highest order or precedence.
In option F, the logical complement operator (&) has the highest order of precedence, so it should be last.
In option G, the assignment operators have the lowest order of precedence, not the highest,
so the last two operators should be first.


### Fill in the blanks: The operators +=, ______, ______, _______, _______, and --
#### are listed in increasing or the same level of operator precedence. (Choose two.)
* A. ^, *, =, ++
* B. %, *, /, &&
* C. =, +, /, *
* D. ^, *, ==, ++
* E. *, /, %, ++
* F. <=, >=, !=, !

In option A, the assignment operator (=) incorrectly
comes after the multiplication (*) operator.
In option B, the short-circuit logical operator (&&) incorrectly comes after the division (/) operator.
In option D, the equality operator (==) incorrectly comes after the multiplication (*)
operator. In option F, the not equals operator (!=) incorrectly comes
after the relational operators, (<= and >=).
This leaves options C and E as the correct answers.
For these answers, it may help to remember that the modulus operator (%),
multiplication operator (*), and division operator (/) have the same operator precedence.

##### Fill in the blanks: The operators !=, _______, _______, _______,
##### and ++ are listed in the same or increasing level of operator precedence. (Choose two.)
* A. ==, *, !
* B. /, %, *
* C. *, --, /
* D. !, *, %
* E. +=, &&, *
* F. *, <, /

Option A is correct and lists the operators in the same
or increasing level of operator precedence. In option B,
the three operators actually have the same operator precedence,
so it is correct. Option C is incorrect, as division (/)
has a lower precedence than the decrement operator (--).
Option D is incorrect because the logical complement operator (!) has
a higher order of precedence than the other two operators.
Option E lists the operators in the correct order,
but they donâ€™t fit within not equals (!=) and the increment operator (++) as listed in the question.
In particular, compound addition operator (+=) and short-circuit logical operator (&&)
have a lower precedence than the not equals operator (!=).
Finally, option F is incorrect because the relational operator
(<) does not fit between multiplication operator (*)
and the division operator (/) in order of precedence.
