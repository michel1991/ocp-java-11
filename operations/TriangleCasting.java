/**
* Option C is incorrect because there is no method named squareRoot.
* There is a sqrt() method; however, you arenâ€™t expected to know it for the exam.
* Options A and D are incorrect because they do not cast to double. 1/2 is integer division, which results in 0 rather than one half.
* Option F is incorrect for the same reason. The cast occurs after all the math has already been done.
* By contrast, option E is correct because the cast to double occurs on the number 1.
* Therefore, dividing by 2 properly results in one half. Options B and E correctly represent the formulas described in the question.
