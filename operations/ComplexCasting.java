        What is the output of the following code snippet?
        A. 1-11-2
        B. 3.0-11.0-2
        C. 1.0-11.0-3
        D. 3.0-13.0-3
        E. 3.0f-12-2
        F. The code does not compile because one of assignments requires an explicit numeric cast.

        Initially, moon is assigned a value of 9, while star is assigned a value of 8.
        The multiplication operator (*) has a higher order of precedence than the addition operator (+), so it gets evaluated first.
        Since star is not greater than 10, sun is assigned a value of 3, which is promoted to 3.0f as part of the assignment.
        The value of jupiter is (3.0f + 9) â€“ 1.0, which is 11.0f.
        This value is implicitly promoted to double when it is assigned.
        In the last assignment, moon is predecremented from 9 to 8, with the value of the expression returned as 8.
        Since 8 less than or equal to 8 is true, mars is set to a value of 2.
        The final output is 3.0-11.0-2, making option B the correct answer.
        Note that while Java outputs the decimal for both float and double values, it does not output the f for float values.
