/**
   Consider the following lines of code:

    boolean greenLight = true;
    boolean pedestrian = false;
    boolean rightTurn = true;
    boolean otherLane = false;
    
    You can go ahead only if  the following expression evaluates to 'true' :
    
    (( (rightTurn && !pedestrian || otherLane)  ||
        ( ? && !pedestrian && greenLight ) )  == true )
    
    What variables can you put in place of '?' so that you can go ahead?
    
    A. rightTurn
    B. otherLane
    C. Any variable would do.
        since the part before second || is true, the next part is not even evaluated.
    D. None of the variable would allow to go.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    Observe that (rightTurn && !pedestrian || otherLane) is true, therefore ( ? && !pedestrian && greenLight ) does not matter.

    || and && are short circuit operators.
    So, if the first part of the expression ( i.e. part before || ) is true ( or false for && )
    the other part is not evaluated at all.
    
    Note that this is not true for | and &.
    In that case, the whole expression will be evaluated even if the value of the expression can be known by just evaluating first part.
    
    Correct(C)
