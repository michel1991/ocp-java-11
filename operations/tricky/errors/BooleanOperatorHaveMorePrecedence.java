 * What is the result of executing the following fragment of code:
    A. Compile time error.
    B. It will print true.
    C. It will print false.
    D. Runtime error.
    E. It will print nothing.
    
    ---------------------------
    Note that  boolean operators have more precedence than =. (In fact, = has least precedence of all operators.)
    so, in (b2 != b1 = !b2)  first b2 != b1 is evaluated which returns a value 'false'. So the expression becomes false = !b2.
    And this is illegal because false is a value and not a variable!
    
    Had it been something like (b2 = b1 != b2) then it is valid because it will boil down to : b2 = false.
    Because all an if() needs is a boolean, now b1 != b2 returns false which is a boolean and as b2 =  false is an expression
    and every expression has a return value (which is actually the Left Hand Side of the expression).
    Here, it returns false, which is again a boolean.
    
    Note that return value of expression :  i = 10 , where i is an int, is 10 (an int).
    Correct(A)
