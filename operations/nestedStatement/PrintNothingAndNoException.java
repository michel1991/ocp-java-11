 Consider the following class :

    public class Test{
       public static void main(String[] args){
          if (args[0].equals("open"))
             if (args[1].equals("someone"))
                System.out.println("Hello!");
          else System.out.println("Go away "+ args[1]);
        }
    }
    
    Which of the following statements are true if the above program is run with the command line :
    java Test closed
    
    A. It will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime.
    B. It will end without exceptions and will print nothing.
    C. It will print Go away
    D. It will print Go away and then will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
    E. None of the above.
    
    ---------
    As in C and C++, the Java if statement suffers from the so-called "dangling else problem,"
    The problem is that both the outer if statement and the inner if statement might conceivably own the else clause.
    In this example, one might be tempted to assume that the programmer intended the else clause to belong to the outer if statement.
    
    The Java language, like C and C++ and many languages before them, arbitrarily decree that an else clause belongs
    to the innermost if so as the first if() condition fails (args[0] not being "open") there is no else associated to execute.
    So, the program does nothing. The else actually is associated with the second if. So had the command line been :
    java Test open, it would have executed the second if and thrown ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
    If the command line had been:
    java Test open xyz, it would execute the else part(which is associated with the second if) and would have printed "Go away xyz".
    Correct(B)
