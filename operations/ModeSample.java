/**
* What is the result of the following code?
*   A. 4
    B. 0
    C. 7
    D. 5
    E. The answer cannot be determined until runtime.
    F. The code will not compile because of line 4.

    The code compiles and runs without issue, so options E and F are incorrect.
     In the order of operations, the first operator applied is the pre-increment operator, resulting in y being assigned a value of 5,
     and the value returned from the operator assigned the new value of 5.
     Next, we apply the division operator since division has a higher order of precedence than subtraction, resulting in an expression of x = 10 - 5 /5 = 10 - 1 = 9.
     Finally, we perform modular arithmetic using the new values of x and yâ€”9 and 5, respectively.
     If we divide these two values, we get 0; therefore, the remainder of 9 % 5 is 4, so option A is the correct answer.
