/**
 * What will the following program print?
    A. 5
    
    B. 9
    Since 9 does not match any of the case labels, it is accepted by default block.
    In this block, the else part is executed, which sets s to the value of s+4, i.e. 9.
    Since there is a break in the else block, case 7: is not executed.
    
    C. 12
    D. It will not compile.
    
    Correct(B)
