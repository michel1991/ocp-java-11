/**
 * What letters will be printed by this program?
   * A.  A
   * B.  B
   * C.  C
   * D.  D
   * F.  F

    1. Defining i as char doesn't mean that it can only hold characters (a, b, c etc).
    It is an integral data type which can take any +ive integer value from 0 to 2^16 -1.
    2. Integer 0 or 1, 2 etc. is not same as char '0', '1' or '2' etc.
    so when i is equal to 0, nothing gets printed and i is incremented to 1 (due to i++ in the switch).
    i is then incremented again by the for loop for next iteration. so i becomes 2.
    when i = 2, "C" is printed and i is incremented to 3 (due to i++ in the switch) and then i is incremented to 4 by the for loop so i becomes 4.
    when i = 4, "E" is printed and since there is no break, it falls through to case 'E' and "F" is printed.
    i is incremented to 5  (due to i++ in the switch) and then it is again incremented to 6 by the for loop. Since i < 5
    is now false, the for loop ends.
    
    Correct(C, F)
