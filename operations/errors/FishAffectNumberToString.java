  What is output by the following code? (Choose all that apply.)
    A. 4 1
    B. 5
    C. 5 tuna
    D. 5tuna
    E. 51tuna
    F. The code does not compile.

     Line 5 does not compile. This question is checking to see whether you are paying attention to the types.
     numFish is an int, and 1 is an int. Therefore, we use numeric addition and get 5.
     The problem is that we canâ€™t store an int in a String variable.
     Supposing line 5 said String anotherFish = numFish + 1 + "";. In that case,
     the answer would be option A and option C.
     The variable defined on line 5 would be the string "5", and both output statements would use concatenation.
