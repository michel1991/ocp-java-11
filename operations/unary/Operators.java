   What will the following program print when run?
     A. 9
     B. -10
     C. -11
     D. -12

  ---------------
    You will need to work out the values of the variables at each line on your worksheet to answer such questions.
    x1 is -4
    x2 is (x1)-- => x2 is first assigned the value of x1 i.e. -4 and then x1 in decremented by 1 to become -5
    x3  is ++(x2) => x2 becomes -3 first and  then its value i.e. -3 is assigned to x3
    x2>x3 is false so x1++  => x1 becomes -4
    
    therefore -4 + -3 + -3 => -10.
     correct(B)
