# Which of the following operators are ranked in increasing or the same order of precedence? Assume the + operator is binary addition, not the unary form. (Choose all that apply.)
A. +, *, %, --
B. ++, (int), *
C. =, ==, !
D. (short), =, !, *
E. *, /, %, +, ==
F. !, ||, &
G. ^, +, =, +=

Options A and C show operators in increasing or the same order of precedence.
Options B and E are in decreasing or the same order of precedence.
Options D, F, and G are in neither increasing or decreasing order of precedence.
In option D, the assignment operator (=) is between two unary operators, with the multiplication operator (*) incorrectly having the highest order or precedence.
In option F, the logical complement operator (&) has the highest order of precedence, so it should be last.
In option G, the assignment operators have the lowest order of precedence, not the highest, so the last two operators should be first.
