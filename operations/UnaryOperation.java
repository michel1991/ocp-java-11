        D. 90
        E. The code will not compile because of line 4.

       The code compiles and runs without issue, so option E is incorrect.
       The pre-increment operator is applied to x, resulting in a value of 9 * (long)10.
       The upcast to long is unnecessary hereâ€”the result will be upcast to long after the multiplication.
       The result is a value of 90, so option D is the correct answer.
