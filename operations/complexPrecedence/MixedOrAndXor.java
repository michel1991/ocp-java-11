        In the first expression, height Ëƒ 1 is true.
        Since it uses the logical operator (|), which evaluates both sides,
        the right side is still executed, resulting in length being assigned a value of 2 and w assigned a value of true.
        In the second expression, only the right-hand side of the expression is evaluated, so x is assigned a value of 2, and length is unchanged.
        The last expression evaluates to 2 % 2, which is 0, so z is assigned a value of 0.
