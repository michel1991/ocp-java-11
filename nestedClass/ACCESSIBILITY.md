### Which access modifiers can be applied to member inner classes? (Choose all that apply.)
* A. static
* B. public
* C. default (package-private)
* D. final
* E. protected
* F. private

Member inner classes, including both classes and interfaces, can be marked with any
of the four access modifiers: public, protected, default (package-private), or private.
For this reason, options B, C, E, and F are correct.
Options A and D are incorrect as static and final are not access modifiers.
