### Which of the following statements are true?
* A. Package member classes can be declared static.
* B. Classes declared as members of top-level classes can be declared static.
* C. Local classes can be declared static.
* D. Anonymous classes cannot be declared static.
* E. No type of class can be declared static.
(Correct B, D)

The modifier static pertains only to member classes,
not to top level or local or anonymous classes.
That is, only classes declared as members of top-level
classes can be declared static. Package member classes,
local classes (i.e. classes declared in methods)
and anonymous classes cannot be declared static.
