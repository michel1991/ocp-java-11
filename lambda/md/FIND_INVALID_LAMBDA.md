### Which of the following is not a valid lambda expression?

* A. (Integer j, k) -> 5
* B. (p,q) -> p+q
* C. (Integer x, Integer y) -> x*y
* D. (left,right) -Ëƒ {return "null";}
* E. All of these are valid.

Option A is the invalid lambda expression because the type is specified for the variable j,
but not the variable k. The rest of the options are valid lambda expressions.
To be a valid lambda expression, the type must be specified for all of the variables,
as in option C, or none of them, as in options B and D.
