### Which of the following is a valid lambda expression?
* A. r -> {return 1==2}
* B. (q) -> true
* C. (x,y) -> {int test; return testËƒ0;}
* D. a,b -> true
* E. None of the above

Option A is incorrect because the lambda expression is missing a semicolon (;)
at the end of the return statement. Option C is incorrect because
the local variable test is used without being initialized. Option D is also incorrect.
The parentheses are required on the left-hand side of the lambda expression when
there is more than one value or a data type is specified.
Option B is the correct answer and the only valid lambda expression.
