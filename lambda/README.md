# Which statements about effectively final variables are true? (Choose all that apply.)
A. The value of an effectively final variable is not modified after it is set.
B. A lambda expression can reference effectively final variables.
C. A lambda expression can reference final variables.
D. If the final modifier is added, the code still compiles.
E. Instance variables can be effectively final.
F. Static variables can be effectively final.
Effectively final refers to local variables whose value is not changed after it is set.
For this reason, option A is correct, and options E and F are incorrect. Options B and C are correct, as lambda expressions can access final and effectively final variables.
Option D is also correct and is a common test for effectively final variables.
