### Which statements about effectively final variables are true? (Choose all that apply.)
* A. The value of an effectively final variable is not modified after it is set.
* B. A lambda expression can reference effectively final variables.
* C. A lambda expression can reference final variables.
* D. If the final modifier is added, the code still compiles.
* E. Instance variables can be effectively final.
* F. Static variables can be effectively final.

Effectively final refers to local variables whose value is not changed after it is set.
For this reason, option A is correct, and options E and F are incorrect. Options B and C are correct, as lambda expressions can access final and effectively final variables.
Option D is also correct and is a common test for effectively final variables.

### Which of the following are valid lambdas that can be assigned to a variable of type Consumer<String>? (Choose all that apply.)
* A. s -> System.out.println(s)
* B. final s -> System.out.println(s)
* C. var s -> System.out.println(s)
* D. (final s) -> System.out.println(s)
* E. (final String s) -> System.out.println(s)
* F. (final var s) -> System.out.println(s)
* G. (var s) -> System.out.println(s)
* H. None of the above

Option A is correct because it is the simplest lambda syntax.
Options B and D are incorrect because the final modifier must precede a type.
While var can replace the type, option C is invalid because the parentheses around the type and variable are missing.
Options E, F, and G are valid because they specify a type and an optional final modifier.

Option D is also correct and is a common test for effectively final variables.

### Which of the following lambda expressions can be passed to a function of Predicate<String> type? (Choose all that apply.)
* A. () -> s.isEmpty()
* B. s -> s.isEmpty()
* C. String s -> s.isEmpty()
* D. (String s) -> s.isEmpty()
* E. (s1) -> s.isEmpty()
* F. (s1, s2) -> s1.isEmpty()

Predicate<String> takes a parameter list of one parameter using the specified type.
Options A and F are incorrect because they specify the wrong number of parameters.
Option C is incorrect because parentheses are required around the parameter list when the type is specified.
Option E is incorrect because the name used in the parameter list does not match the name used in the body.

### Which of the following are valid lambdas that can be assigned to a variable of type Consumer<String>? (Choose all that apply.)
* A. s -> System.out.println(s)
* B. final s -> System.out.println(s)
* C. var s -> System.out.println(s)
* D. (final s) -> System.out.println(s)
* E. (final String s) -> System.out.println(s)
* F. (final var s) -> System.out.println(s)
* G. (var s) -> System.out.println(s)

Option A is correct because it is the simplest lambda syntax. Options B and D are incorrect because the final modifier must precede a type.
While var can replace the type, option C is invalid because the parentheses around the type and variable are missing.
Options E, F, and G are valid because they specify a type and an optional final modifier.

### Which statement is true?
* A. All lambdas can be converted to method references, and vice versa.
* B. All lambdas can be converted to method references, but not vice versa.
* C. All method references can be converted to lambdas, but not vice versa.
* D. None of the above.

Method references are a shorter way of writing lambdas, and all method references can be expanded to lambdas.
However, this does not apply in reverse. Consider the lambda: () -Ëƒ s.charAt(n).
The n variable can only be an effectively final variable in lambdas, but not in method references.
Since only method references can always be converted, option C is correct.
