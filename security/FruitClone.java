     * The following code prints false. Which statements best describe the Fruit class? (Choose three.)
        A. It does not implement Cloneable.
        B. It performs a deep copy.
        C. It performs a shallow copy.
        D. It overrides clone().
        E. It implements Cloneable.
        F. It does not override clone().
        
        The Fruit class must implement Cloneable;
        otherwise,an exception would be thrown at runtime, making option E correct.
        The Fruit class must also override the clone() method.
        If it did not, then a shallow copy would be performed on the sweet object,
        resulting in the code printing true at runtime. Since this is not the case,
        option D is correct. Finally, weâ€™ve already ruled out a shallow copy,
        so by process of elimination it must perform a deep copy.
        For this reason, option B is correct.
