### Given an automobile sales system, which of the following information is best stored using an annotation?
* A. The price of the vehicle
* B. A list of people who purchased the vehicle
* C. The sales tax of the vehicle
* D. The number of passengers a vehicle is rated for
* E. The quantity of models in stock

Annotations should include metadata (data about data) that is relatively constant,
as opposed to attribute data, which is part of the object and can change frequently.
The price, sales, inventory, and people who purchased a vehicle could fluctuate often,
so using an annotation would be a poor choice.
On the other hand, the number of passengers a vehicle is rated for is extra information
about the vehicle and unlikely to change once established.
Therefore, it is appropriate metadata and best served using an annotation.

### Given a zoo management system, which of the following is best stored using an annotation?
* A. The number of animals currently in the zoo
* B. The names of each animal
* C. The number of visitors to the zoo each year
* D. The number of people who bought tickets to the zoo on a given day
* E. The number of animals that can fit in an enclosure

Annotations should include metadata (data about data) that is relatively constant,
as opposed to attribute data, which is part of the object and can change frequently.
The number of animals in the zoo, their names, and the guests of the zoo can change throughout the day,
so that information is best stored as part of the data.
The number of animals that can fit in an enclosure defines a rule about the enclosure.
It does not include how many animals are actually in each enclosure;
therefore, it is appropriate metadata and best served using an annotation.

##### Given a Broadway show, which information is best stored using annotations? (Choose two.)
* A. The number of people attending each day
* B. The maximum number of tickets a person can purchase
* C. The total number of people the theater can hold
* D. The price including discounts a person pays for a ticket
* E. A personâ€™s seat assignment
* F. The time a ticket is sold

Annotations are about storing metadata, or data about data.
The maximum number of tickets per person and total number of people
the theater can hold define rules that are unlikely to change frequently,
so they are best stored with annotations. The number of people attending,
price, and time the ticket is sold are likely to change frequently
and should be part of the transactional information for the ticket.
The seat assignment also changes for every ticket sold.
