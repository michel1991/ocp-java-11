/**
   What may be the result of executing the following program?
    A. The program asks the user a question and prints the results to the error stream.
    B. The program throws a NullPointerException at runtime.
    C. The program does not terminate.
    D. All of the above.
    E. The class does not compile.

    The statements in options A, B, and C are each correct, making option D correct.
    If System.console() is available, then the program will ask the user a question and then print the response to the error stream.
    On the other hand, if System.console() is not available, then the program will exit with a NullPointerException.
    It is strongly recommended to always check whether System.
    console() is null after requesting it.
    Finally, the user may choose not to respond to the programâ€™s request for input, resulting in the program hanging indefinitely.
