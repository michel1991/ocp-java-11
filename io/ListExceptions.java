/**
* Question: Which of the following exceptions do not need to be handled or declared in the method in which they are thrown? (Choose all that apply.)
* An exception that does not need to be handled or declared is an unchecked exception.
* An unchecked exception inherits RuntimeException or Error. The entire hierarchy counts, so options A, B, and E are all correct.
*  Even if you donâ€™t know what OutOfMemoryError is, the fact that it ends with an Error is a strong indication that it is an unchecked exception.
