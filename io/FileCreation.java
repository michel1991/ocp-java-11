      Suppose that the absolute path /weather/winter/snow.dat represents a
      file that exists within the file system. Which of the following lines of code creates an
       object that represents the file? (Choose all that apply.)

        A.
            new File("/weather", "winter", "snow.dat")

        B.
            new File("/weather/winter/snow.dat")

        C.
            new File("/weather/winter", new File("snow.dat"))

        D.
            new File("weather", "/winter/snow.dat")

        E.
            new File(new File("/weather/winter"), "snow.dat")

        F. None of the above

        Option A does not compile, as there is no File constructor that takes three parameters.
        Option B is correct and is the proper way to create a File instance with a single String parameter.
        Option C is incorrect, as there is no constructor that takes a String followed by a File.
        There is a constructor that takes a File followed by a String, making option E correct.
        Option D is incorrect because the first parameter is missing a slash (/) to indicate it is an absolute path.
        Since it’s a relative path, it is correct only when the user’s current directory is the root directory.
