# Which of the following are not java.io classes? (Choose all that apply.)
A. BufferedReader
B. BufferedWriter
C. FileReader
D. FileWriter
E. PrintReader
F. PrintWriter

PrintStream and PrintWriter are the only I/O classes that you need to know that donâ€™t have a complementary InputStream or Reader class, so option E is correct.
