### Where can a final instance variable be assigned a value? (Choose three.)
*  A. Instance initializer
*  B. static initializer
*  C. Instance method
*  D. On the line it is declared
*  E. Class constructor
*  F. static method

A final instance must be assigned a value (exactly once) on the line it is declared,
in an instance initializer, or in a constructor. This makes options A, D, and E correct.
