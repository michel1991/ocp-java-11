   what will the following code print?
    A. 0.0   false
    B. 0.0f   false
    C. 0.0 0 false
    D. 0.0   true
    E. 0.0f   true
    F. 0.0f 0 true
    
    This question tests you on two aspects - 
1. the default values that are given to variables of various primitive types.
  You should remember that all numeric types, including char, get the value of 0 (or 0.0 for float and double)
  and boolean gets the value of false.

2. how the value is printed by System.out.print method - java.lang.System class
 has a public static variable named out, which is of class java.io.PrintStream.
 The PrintStream class has multiple print/println methods for printing out primitive values as well as objects. 
    For byte, short, and int, these print/println methods simply print the integer value as it is.

    For char, the print/println methods translate the character into one or more bytes
    according to the platform's default character encoding.
    That is why while printing a char value of 0, a blank space is printed instead
    of 0 (even though the char's integral value is 0).

   For long, float, and double values, these print/println methods use the respective
   primitive wrapper class's toString method to get the String representation of that primitive.
   For example, to print the value of a float variable f, it internally calls Float.toString(f).
   Now, this method doesn't append an "f" at the end of a float value.
   That is why a float value of 0.0 is printed as 0.0 and not 0.0f.
   
   (correct A)
