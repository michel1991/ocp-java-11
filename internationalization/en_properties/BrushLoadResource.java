        E. The code does not compile.
        F. An exception is thrown at runtime.
        
        Java starts out by looking for a properties file with the requested locale.
        In this case, the requested locale is the fr language, which it finds with toothbrush_fr.properties.
        For this reason, the default locale of es_MX is ignored,
        and the first value for color printed is violette.
        Next, it looks for a value for type property.
        Since it doesnâ€™t find it in the first properties file,
        it checks the default toothbrush.properties,
        where it does find it, and prints generic. For these reasons, option B is correct.
