           Assuming the key turquoise is in all five of the files referenced in the options,

            F. None of the above

            Java starts out by looking for a properties file with the requested locale,
           which in this case is the zh_CN language and country.
           It doesnâ€™t find it, so it moves onto the locale with just a language code zh, which it also does not find.
            It then moves on to the default locale en_US, but there is still no match.
           It drops the country code and does find a match with en, making option A correct
