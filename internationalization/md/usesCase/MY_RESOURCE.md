### Given that your code is being run in a locale where the language code is fr and country code is CA,
### which of the following file names represents a valid resource bundle file name?

* A. MyResource_fr_CA.xml
* B. MyResource_fr_CA.properties
* C. MyResource_fr_CA.java
* D. MyResource_fr_CA.profile

A resource bundle file could be a properties file or a class file.

The abstract class ResourceBundle has two subclasses: PropertyResourceBundle and ListResourceBundle.

A PropertyResourceBundle is backed by a properties file. A properties file is a plain-text file that contains translatable text.
Properties files are not part of the Java source code, and they can contain values for String objects only.
If you need to store other types of objects, use a ListResourceBundle instead.

The ListResourceBundle class manages resources with a convenient list. Each ListResourceBundle is backed by a class file.
You can store any locale-specific object in a ListResourceBundle.
To add support for an additional Locale, you create another source file and compile it into a class file.

The ResourceBundle class is flexible.
If you first put your locale-specific String objects in a PropertyResourceBundle and then later decided to use ListResourceBundle instead,
there is no impact on your code. For example, the following call to getBundle will retrieve a ResourceBundle for the appropriate Locale,
whether ButtonLabel is backed up by a class or by a properties file:

ResourceBundle introLabels = ResourceBundle.getBundle("ButtonLabel", currentLocale);

Correct (B)
