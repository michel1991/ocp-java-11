/**
 * The key to this question is keeping track of the types. Line 48 is a Map<Integer, Integer>.
 * Line 49 builds a List out of a Set of Entry objects, giving us List<Entry<Integer, Integer>>.
 * This causes a compile error on line 56 since we canâ€™t multiply an Entry object by two.
 * Lines 51 through 54 are all of type List<Integer>. The first three are immutable, and the one on line 54 is mutable.
 * This means line 57 throws an UnsupportedOperationException since we attempt to modify the list.
 * Line 58 would work if we could get to it. Since there is one compiler error and one runtime error, options A and E are correct.
