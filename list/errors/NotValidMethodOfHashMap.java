      This question looks like it is about generics, but itâ€™s not.
      It is trying to see whether you noticed that Map does not have a contains() method.
     It has containsKey() and containsValue() instead. If containsKey() was called, the answer would be false because 123 is an Integer key in the Map, rather than a String.
