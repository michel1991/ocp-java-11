### Which is true of a PreparedStatement?
*  A. It has a method to change the bind variable to a different character other than ?.
*  B. It can be usedonly for SELECT statements.
*  C. It can be usedonly for UPDATE statements.
*  D. All of these are true.
*  E. None of these are true.

In JDBC, the bind variable is always a question mark (?), making option A incorrect.
A PreparedStatatement is not limited to specific types of SQL, making options B and C incorrect as well.
This makes option E the correct answer.
