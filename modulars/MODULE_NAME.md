### Which of the following are modules supplied by the JDK? (Choose three.)
*  A. java.logging
*  B. java.javadoc
*  C. java.jdk
*  D. java.management
*  E. java.naming
*  F. java.scripts

The java.logging, java.management, and java.naming modules exist, making options A, D, and E correct.
Option B is tempting. However, jdk.javadoc exists, not java.javadoc. Options C and F are completely made up.

### Which of the following are modules supplied by the JDK? (Choose three.)
A. jdk.base
B. jdk.basic
C. jdk.desktop
D. jdk.javadoc
E. jdk.jdeps
F. jdk.net

The java.base module is automatically available to any module without specifying it.
However, this question tries to trick you with option A by specifying jdk.base instead.
Similarly, java.desktop exists, but not jdk.deskop, making option C wrong.
Options D, E, and F are correct because jdk.javadoc , jdk.jdeps, and jdk.net are modules supplied with the JDK.
You do need to be able to recognize the names of built-in modules.

### Which module is available to your named module without needing a requires directive?
* A. java.all
*  B. java.base
*  C. java.default
*  D. java.lang
*  E. None of the above

Option B is correct because java.base is provided by default. It contains the java.lang package among others.

### Which of the following modules contains the java.sql package? (Choose all that apply.)
*  A. java.base;
*  B. java.database;
*  C. java.jdbc;
*  D. java.sql;
*  E. None of the above

Sorry. You just need to memorize this. The java.sql package is in the java.sql module, making option D correct. It just so happens to have the same name.
