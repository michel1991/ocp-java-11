### Which of the following are modules supplied by the JDK? (Choose three.)
*  A. java.logging
*  B. java.javadoc
*  C. java.jdk
*  D. java.management
*  E. java.naming
*  F. java.scripts

The java.logging, java.management, and java.naming modules exist, making options A, D, and E correct.
Option B is tempting. However, jdk.javadoc exists, not java.javadoc. Options C and F are completely made up.

### Which module is available to your named module without needing a requires directive?
* A. java.all
*  B. java.base
*  C. java.default
*  D. java.lang
*  E. None of the above

Option B is correct because java.base is provided by default. It contains the java.lang package among others.

### Which of the following modules contains the java.sql package? (Choose all that apply.)
*  A. java.base;
*  B. java.database;
*  C. java.jdbc;
*  D. java.sql;
*  E. None of the above

Sorry. You just need to memorize this. The java.sql package is in the java.sql module, making option D correct. It just so happens to have the same name.
