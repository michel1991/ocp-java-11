### Which of the following are modules supplied by the JDK? (Choose three.)
*  A. java.logging
*  B. java.javadoc
*  C. java.jdk
*  D. java.management
*  E. java.naming
*  F. java.scripts

The java.logging, java.management, and java.naming modules exist, making options A, D, and E correct.
Option B is tempting. However, jdk.javadoc exists, not java.javadoc. Options C and F are completely made up.
