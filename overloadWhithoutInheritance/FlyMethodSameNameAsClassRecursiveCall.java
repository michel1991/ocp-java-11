/**
    How many lines of the following class contain compilation errors?
    A. None.
    B. One.
    C. Two.
    D. Three.
    E. Four.
    F. The answer cannot be determined with the information given.

  As ugly as the class looks, it does compile, making option A correct.
  Lines 2â€“4 each define an instance method since they each have a name and return type.
  There is no rule saying you cannot define a method with the same name as the class,
  although it is considered bad style.
  The main() method calls the default no-argument constructor on line 6,
  inserted by the compiler.
  Finally, line 7 calls the method declared on line 2.
