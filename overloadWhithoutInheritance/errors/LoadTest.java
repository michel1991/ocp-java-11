  What will be printed when the following code is compiled and run?

   B. 4.0
   C. 4
   D. The code will not compile.
   
    You cannot have more than one method in a class with the same signature.
   Method signature includes method name and the argument list but does not include return type.
    Therefore, the two getLoad() methods have the same signature and will not compile.
    
    This shows that method overloading cannot be done on the basis of the return types.
