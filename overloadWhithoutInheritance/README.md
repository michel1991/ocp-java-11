#### Fill in the blanks: ___________________ methods always have the same name
#### but a different list of parameters, while ___________________ methods
##### always have the same name and the same return type.
* A. Overloaded, overridden
* B. Inherited, overridden
* C. Overridden, overloaded
* D. Hidden, overloaded
* E. Overridden, hidden
* F. None of the above

Trick question! Overloaded methods is correct in the first part of the sentence,
but none of the answers is correct in the second part of the sentence.
Remember, overridden methods can have covariant return types.
They do not need to be the same. For this reason, option F is the correct answer.
