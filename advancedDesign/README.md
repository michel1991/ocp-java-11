# Which of the following are true statements about a class Camel with a single instance variable List<String> species? (Choose all that apply.)
    A. If Camel is well encapsulated, then it must have restricted extensibility.
    B. If Camel is well encapsulated, then it must be immutable.
    C. If Camel has restricted extensibility, then it must have good encapsulation.
    D. If Camel has restricted extensibility, then it must be immutable.
    E. If Camel is immutable, then it must have good encapsulation.
    F. If Camel is immutable, then it must restrict extensibility.

    Option A is incorrect because good encapsulation requires private state rather than declaring the class final.
    Option B is incorrect because the well-encapsulated Camel class can have a getter that exposes the species variable to be modified.
    Options C and D are incorrect because a class can be final while having public variables and be mutable.
    Option E is correct because methods that expose species could change it, which would prevent immutability.
    Option F is correct because you cannot enforce immutability in a subclass.

 # Which of the following statements are correct? (Choose all that apply.)
    A. The return value of an assignment operation expression can be void.
    B. The inequality operator (!=) can be used to compare objects.
    C. The equality operator (==) can be used to compare a boolean value with a numeric value.
    D. During runtime, the && and | operators may cause only the left side of the expression to be evaluated.
    E. The return value of an assignment operation expression is the value of the newly assigned variable.
    F. In Java, 0 and false may be used interchangeably.
    G. The logical complement operator (!) cannot be used to flip numeric values.

The return value of an assignment operation in the expression is the same as the value of the newly assigned variable.
For this reason, option A is incorrect, and option E is correct.
Option B is correct, and the equality (==) and inequality (!=) operators can both be used with objects.
Option C is incorrect, as boolean and numeric types are not comparable with each other.
For example, you canâ€™t say true == 3 without a compilation error.
Option D is incorrect, as only the short-circuit operator (&&) may cause only the left side of the expression to be evaluated.
The (|) operator will cause both sides to be evaluated.
Option F is incorrect, as Java does not accept numbers for boolean values.
Finally, option G is correct, as you need to use the negation operator (-) to flip or negate numeric values, not the logical complement operator (!).

# Which of the following statements is true?
A. Package-private access is more lenient than protected access.
B. A public class that has private fields and package-private methods is not visible to classes outside the package.
C. You can use access modifiers so only some of the classes in a package see a particular package-private class.
D. You can use access modifiers to allow access to all methods and not any instance variables.
E. You can use access modifiers to restrict access to all classes that begin with the word Test.

Option D is correct. This is the common implementation for encapsulation by setting all fields to be private and all methods to be public.
Option A is incorrect because protected access allows everything that package-private access allows and additionally allows subclasses access.
Option B is incorrect because the class is public.
This means that other classes can see the class.
However, they cannot call any of the methods or read any of the fields.
It is essentially a useless class. Option C is incorrect because package-private access applies to the whole package.
Option E is incorrect because Java has no such wildcard access capability.

# Which of the following statements about unary operators are true? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Unary operators are always executed before any surrounding binary or ternary operators.
B. The - operator can be used to flip a boolean value.
C. The pre-increment operator (++) returns the value of the variable before the increment is applied.
D. The post-decrement operator (--) returns the value of the variable before the decrement is applied.
E. The ! operator cannot be used on numeric values.
F. None of the above

Unary operators have the highest order of precedence, making option A correct.
The negation operator (-) is used only for numeric values, while the logical complement operator (!) is used exclusively for boolean values.
For these reasons, option B is incorrect, and option E is correct.
Finally, the pre-increment/pre-decrement operators return the new value of the variable, while the post-increment/post-decrement operators return the original variable.
For these reasons, option C is incorrect, and option D is correct.

# Which of the following are true statements? (Choose all that apply.)
A. The JDK contains a compiler.
B. The JVM contains a compiler.
C. The javac command creates a file containing bytecode.
D. The java command creates a file containing bytecode.
E. The JDK is contained in the JVM.
F. The JVM is contained in the JDK.

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is used when creating Java programs.
It contains a compiler since it is a development tool making option A correct and option B incorrect.
The JDK contains a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) making option F correct and option E incorrect.
The compiler creates bytecode making option C correct and option D incorrect. For more information, see Chapter 1.


# Given the following classes, which of the following snippets can independently be inserted in place of INSERT IMPORTS HERE and have the code compile? (Choose all that apply.)

```java
    package aquarium;
    public class Water {
        boolean salty = false;
        }

    package aquarium.jellies;
    public class Water {
        boolean salty = true;
        }

    package employee;
    INSERT IMPORTS HERE
    public class WaterFiller {
        Water water;
        }
```

    Option A is correct because it imports all the classes in the aquarium package including aquarium.Water.
    Options B and C are correct because they import Water by class name.
    Since importing by class name takes precedence over wildcards, these compile.
    Option D is incorrect because Java doesn't know which of the two wildcard Water classes to use.
    Option E is incorrect because you cannot specify the same class name in two imports.

# What motivations would a developer have for applying the @FunctionalInterface annotation to an interface? (Choose all that apply.)
A. To allow the interface to be used in a lambda expression
B. To provide documentation to other developers
C. To allow the interface to be used as a method reference
D. There is no reason to use this annotation.
E. To trigger a compiler error if the annotation is used incorrectly

The @FunctionalInterface marker annotation is used to document that an interface is a valid functional interface that contains exactly one abstract method, making option B correct.
It is also useful in determining whether an interface is a valid functional interface, as the compiler will report an error if used incorrectly, making option E correct.
The compiler can detect whether an interface is a functional interface even without the annotation, making options A and C incorrect.

# Which statements are true for both abstract classes and interfaces? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Both can be extended using the extends keyword.
B. All methods within them are assumed to be abstract.
C. Both can contain public static final variables.
D. The compiler will insert the implicit abstract modifier automatically on methods declared without a body, if they are not marked as such.
E. Both interfaces and abstract classes can be declared with the abstract modifier.
F. Both inherit java.lang.Object.

A class may extend another class, and an interface may extend another interface, making option A correct.
Option B is incorrect. An abstract class can contain concrete instance or static methods.
Interfaces can also contain nonabstract methods, although knowing this is not required for the 1Z0-815 exam.
Option C is correct, as both can contain static constants. Option D is incorrect. The compiler only inserts implicit modifiers for interfaces.
For abstract classes, the abstract keyword must be used on any method that does not define a body.
An abstract class must be declared with the abstract keyword, while the abstract keyword is optional for interfaces.
Since both can be declared with the abstract keyword, option E is correct. Finally, interfaces do not extend java.lang.Object.
If they did, then Java would support true multiple inheritance, with multiple possible parent constructors being called as part of initialization.
Therefore, option F is incorrect.

# Which of the following data types cannot be used in a switch statement? (Choose all that apply.)
A. float
B. Character
C. var
D. byte
E. Double
F. Object
G. Integer
H. char[]

A switch statement supports the primitives int, byte, short, and char, along with their associated wrapper classes Integer, Byte, Short, and Character, respectively.
A switch statement also supports var if the type can be resolved to a supported switch data types.
For these reasons, options B, C, D, and G are permitted in switch statements and, therefore, incorrect.
Options A and E are correct as long, float, double, and their associated wrapped classes Long, Float, and Double, respectively, are not supported in switch statements.
Option F is correct, as Object is not a supported data type in a switch statement. Finally, option H is incorrect.
While switch statements support String, a char[] is not the same as a String.
