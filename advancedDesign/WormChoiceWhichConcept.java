  Which of the following is the code an example of? (Choose all that apply.)
    A. Immutability
    B. Input validation
    C. Limiting accessibility
    D. Restricting extensibility
    E. None of the above

    Since the class is final, it restricts extensibility, making option D correct.
    The private variable limits accessibility, making option C correct.
    Finally, option A is correct.
    This is an immutable class since itâ€™s not possible to change the state after construction.
    This class does not do any validation, making option B incorrect.
