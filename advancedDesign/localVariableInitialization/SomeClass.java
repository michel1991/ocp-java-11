    Which of the changes given in options can be done (independent of each other) to let the following
    code compile and run without errors when its generateReport method is called?
        class SomeClass{
       String s1 = "green mile";   // 0
       public void generateReport( int n ){
          String local;   // 1
          if( n > 0 ) local = "good";   //2
          System.out.println( s1+" = " + local );   //3
       }
    }
    
    A. Replace String at //0 with var.
         This will introduce a new error because var declarations cannot be used to define class or instance fields.
         
   B.  Insert after line 2 : if(n <= 0) local = "bad";
   C. Move line 1 and place it after line 0.
   
   D.  change line 1 to : final String local = "rocky";
        Making it final will not let //2 compile as it would then try to modify a final variable.
        
   E. Insert after line 2 : else local = "bad";
   F.  The program already is without any errors.
   
   --------------

    The problem is that local is declared inside a method is therefore local to that method. 
    It is called a local variable (also known as automatic variable) and it cannot be used before initialized.
    Further, it will not be initialized unless you initialize it explicitly because local variables are not initialized by the JVM on its own.
    The compiler spots the usage of such uninitialized variables and ends with an error message.

    1. Making it a member variable (choice "Move line 1 and place it after line 0.") will initialize it to null.
    2. Putting an else part (choice "Insert after line 2 : else local = "bad";") will ensure that it is initialized to either 'good' or 'bad'.
     So this also works.
    Choice "Insert after line 2 : if(n <= 0) local = "bad";" doesn't work because the second 'if' will actually
    be another statement and is not considered as a part of first 'if'. So, compiler doesn't realize that 'local'
    will be initialized even though it does get initialized.
