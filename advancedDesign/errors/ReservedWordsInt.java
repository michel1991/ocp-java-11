     * Given the following method, what is the first line that does not compile?

        Integer is the name of a class in Java.
        While it is bad practice to use the name of a class as your local variable name, this is legal.
        Therefore, k1 does compile. It is not legal to use a reserved word as a variable name.
        All of the primitives including int are reserved words.
        Therefore, k2 does not compile, and option B is the answer.
        Lines k4 and k5 donâ€™t compile either, but the question asks about the first line to not compile.
