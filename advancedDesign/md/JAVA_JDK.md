### Which of the following are true statements? (Choose all that apply.)
*  A. Java allows operator overloading.
*  B. Java code compiled on Windows can run on Linux.
*  C. Java has pointers to specific locations in memory.
*  D. Java is a procedural language.
*  E. Java is an object-oriented language.
*  F. Java is a functional programming language

C++ has operator overloading and pointers.
Java made a point of not having either.
Java does have references to objects, but these are pointing to an object that can move around in memory.
Option B is correct because Java is platform independent.
Option E is correct because Java is object oriented.
While it does support some parts of functional programming, these occur within a class.

### Which of the following are true statements? (Choose all that apply.)
* A. The JDK contains a compiler.
* B. The JVM contains a compiler.
* C. The javac command creates a file containing bytecode.
* D. The java command creates a file containing bytecode.
* E. The JDK is contained in the JVM.
* F. The JVM is contained in the JDK.

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is used when creating Java programs.
It contains a compiler since it is a development tool making option A correct and option B incorrect.
The JDK contains a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) making option F correct and option E incorrect.
The compiler creates bytecode making option C correct and option D incorrect. For more information, see Chapter 1.

### java ______ library.jar MainClass.class
*  A. -cp
*  B. -classpath
*  C. -class-path
*  D. --classpath
*  E. --class-path
*  F. None of the above

When running the java command,
you pass the name of the class rather than the name of the class file.
If you are using the single-file source-code feature,
you use the name of the Java file.
Since none of the options accepts the class filename, option F is correct.
