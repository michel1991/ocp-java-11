##### Which statements about abstract classes and methods are correct? (Choose three.)
* A. An abstract class can be extended by a final class.
* B. An abstract method can be overridden by a final method.
* C. An abstract class can be extended by multiple classes directly.
* D. An abstract class can extend multiple classes directly.
* E. An abstract class cannot implement an interface.
* F. An abstract class can extend an interface.

Options A, B, and C are correct statements about abstract classes.
Option D is incorrect as Java allows a class to extend only one class directly,
abstract or otherwise. Option E is incorrect, as a class can implement or inherit an interface.
Option F is also incorrect as classes can only extend classes, and interfaces can only extend interfaces.
