### What is true of the following method?

```java
public void printColor() {
    System.out.println(color);
}
```
* A. It is a correctly implemented accessor method.
* B. It is a correctly implemented mutator method.
* C. It is an incorrectly implemented accessor method.
* D. It is an incorrectly implemented mutator method.
* E. None of the above.

This method does not set or return a value so it is not an accessor or mutator.
Therefore, option E is correct.
