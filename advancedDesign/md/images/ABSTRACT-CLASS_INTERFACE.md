### Which are true statements about interfaces and abstract classes? (Choose three.)
* A. Abstract classes offer support for single inheritance, while interfaces offer support for multiple inheritance.
* B. All methods in abstract classes are public, while interfaces can use various access modifiers for their methods and variables, including private in some cases.
* C. Both abstract classes and interfaces can have abstract methods.
* D. Both abstract classes and interfaces can have public constructors.
* E. Interfaces can only extend other interfaces, while abstract classes can extend both abstract and concrete classes.
* F. Unlike abstract classes, interfaces can be marked final.

Option B is incorrect as abstract classes allow any of the access modifiers.
Option D is incorrect because interfaces do not have constructors.
Option F is incorrect because neither abstract classes nor interfaces can be marked final.
Options A, C, and E are true statements.
