### Fill in the blanks: Because of ___________, it is possible to ___________ a method, which allows Java to support ___________.
* A. abstract methods, override, inheritance
* B. virtual methods, override, polymorphism
* C. concrete methods, overload, inheritance
* D. virtual methods, overload, interfaces
* E. inheritance, abstract, polymorphism
* F. abstract methods, inherit, multiple inheritance

For this question, it helps to try all answers out.
Most of them do not make any sense. For example,
overloading a method is not a facet of inheritance.
Likewise, concrete and abstract methods can both be overridden, not just one.
The only answer that is valid is option B.
Without virtual methods, overriding a method would not be possible,
and Java would not truly support polymorphism.
