### Which of the following are valid comments in Java? (Choose three.)
* A. /****** TODO */
* B. # Fix this bug later
* C. ' Error closing pod bay doors
* D. / Invalid record /
* E. /* Page not found */
* F. // IGNORE ME

Java supports three types of comments: single-line (//),
multiline (/* */), and Javadoc (/** **/),
making options A, E, and F correct. The other options may be comments in other languages, but not in Java.
