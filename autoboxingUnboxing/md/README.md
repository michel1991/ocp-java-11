#### Identify examples of autoboxing.

* A. Float f = 2.0;
   This will not compile.
* B. Float f = 2.0f;
* C. Byte b = 2;
* D. Character c = 2;
* E. String s = "x";
The concept of autoboxing is applicable to primitive types
(byte, char, short, int, long, float, double, and boolean) only.
String is a not a primitive type. It is a reference type.

(Correct are B, C, D)
