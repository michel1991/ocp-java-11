        The array brackets, [], are not allowed to appear before the type,
         making the lions declaration incorrect.
         When using an array initializer with braces, {},
         you are not allowed to specify the size separately.
         The size is inferred from the number of elements listed.
          Therefore, tigers and ohMy are incorrect.
          When youâ€™re not using an array initializer,
          the size is required. An empty array initializer is allowed.
          Option B is correct because only bears is legal.
