     * What is true about the output of the following code?

        A. It is negative because ints has fewer elements.
        B. It is 0 because the arrays canâ€™t be compared.
        C. It is positive because the first element is larger.
        D. It is undefined.
        E. The code does not compile.

     The Arrays.compare() method looks at each element in turn.
     Since the first elements are different, we get the result of comparing them.
     In this case, we get a positive number because 3 is larger than 2, and option C is correct.
