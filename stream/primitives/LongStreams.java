        D.
            opt.ifPresent(System.out::println);
        E. None of these; the code does not compile.
        F. None of these; line 5 throws an exception at runtime.

      Lines 4â€“6 compile and run without issue, making option F incorrect.
      Line 4 creates a stream of elements [1, 2, 3]. Line 5 maps the stream to a new stream with values [10, 20, 30].
      Line 6 filters out all items not less than 5, which in this case results in an empty stream. For this reason, findFirst() returns an empty Optional.
      Option A does not compile. It would work for a Stream<T> object, but we have a LongStream and therefore need to call getAsLong().
      Option C also does not compile, as it is missing the :: that would make it a method reference.
      Options B and D both compile and run without error, although neither produces any output at runtime since the stream is empty.
