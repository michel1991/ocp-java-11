      What statements about the following code are true? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. The first value printed is always 1.
        B. The second value printed is always 6.
        C. The code will not compile because of line y1.
        D. The code will not compile because of line y2.
        E. The code compiles but throws an exception at runtime.
        F. The output cannot be determined ahead of time.
        G. It compiles but waits forever at runtime.

        The code compiles and runs without issue, so options C, D, E, and G are incorrect.
        There are two important things to notice.
        First, synchronizing on the first variable doesnâ€™t actually impact the results of the code.
        Second, sorting on a parallel stream does not mean that findAny() will return the first record.
        The findAny() method will return the value from the first thread that retrieves a record.
         Therefore, the output is not guaranteed, and option F is correct.
         Option A looks correct, but even on serial streams, findAny() is free to select any element.
