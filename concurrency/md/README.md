#### Which of the following static methods does not exist in the Executors class? (Choose two.)
* A. newFixedScheduledThreadPool()
* B. newThreadPool()
* C. newFixedThreadPool(int)
* D. newSingleThreadExecutor()
* E. newScheduledThreadPool(int)
* F. newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()

Options C, D, E, and F are all proper ways to obtain instances of ExecutorService.
Remember that newSingleThreadExecutor() is equivalent to calling newFixedThreadPool(int)
with a value of 1. The correct answers are options A and B, as neither of these methods exist.

#### Which ScheduledExecutorService method
#### can result in the same action being executed
#### by two threads at the same time?
* A. scheduleAtFixedDelay()
* B. scheduleAtFixedRate()
* C. scheduleWithFixedDelay()
* D. scheduleAtSameRate()
* E. scheduleWithRate()
* F. None of the above

Options A, D, and E include method names that do not exist in ScheduledExecutorService.
The scheduleAtFixedRate() method creates a new task for the associated action
at a set time interval, even if previous tasks for the same action are still active.
In this manner, it is possible multiple threads working
on the same action could be executing at the same time,
making option B the correct answer. On the other hand,
scheduleWithFixedDelay() waits until each task is completed before scheduling the next task,
guaranteeing at most one thread working on the action is active in the thread pool.

#### Fill in the blanks: ______________ is a special case of ______________,
#### in which two or more active threads try
#### to acquire the same set of locks and are repeatedly unsuccessful.
* A. Deadlock, livelock
* B. Deadlock, resource starvation
* C. Livelock, resource starvation
* D. Resource starvation, race conditions
* E. Resource starvation, livelock
* F. None of the above

Resource starvation is when a single active thread is perpetually unable
to gain access to a shared resource. Livelock is a special
case of resource starvation, in which two or more active
threads are unable to gain access to shared resources,
repeating the process over and over again.
For these reasons, option C is the correct answer.
Deadlock and livelock are similar,
although in a deadlock situation the threads are stuck waiting,
rather than being active or performing any work.
Finally, a race condition is an undesirable
result when two tasks that should be completed sequentially are completed at the same time.

#### The following diagrams represent the order of read/write
#### operations of two threads sharing a common variable.
#### Each thread first reads the value of the variable from memory
#### and then writes a new value of the variable back to memory.
#### Which diagram demonstrates proper synchronization?

Part of synchronizing access to a variable is ensuring that read/write operations
are atomic or happen without interruption. For example,
an increment operation requires reading a value and then immediately writing it.
If any thread interrupts this process, then data could be lost.
In this regard, option C shows proper synchronized access.
Thread 2 reads a value and then writes it without interruption.
Thread 1 then reads the new value and writes it.
The rest of the answers are incorrect because
one thread writes data to the variable in-between another
thread reading and writing to the same variable.
Because a thread is writing data to a variable
that has already been written to by another thread, it may set invalid data.
For example, two increment operations running
at the same time could result in one of the increment operations being lost.

#### Letâ€™s say you needed a thread executor to create tasks
#### for a CyclicBarrier that has a barrier limit of five threads.
#### Which static method in ExecutorService should you use to obtain it?
* A. newSingleThreadExecutor()
* B. newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()
* C. newCachedThreadPool()
* D. newFixedThreadPool(2)
* E. None of the above

Trick question! ExecutorService does not contain any of these methods.
To obtain an instance of a thread executor, you need to use the Executors factory class.
For this reason, option E is the correct answer.
If the question had instead asked which Executors method to use,
then the correct answer would be option C.
Options A, B, and D do not create enough threads
for a CyclicBarrier expecting to reach a limit of five concurrent threads.
Option C, on the other hand,
will create threads as needed and is appropriate for use with a CyclicBarrier.
