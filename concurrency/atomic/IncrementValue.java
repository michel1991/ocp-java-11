/**
    What statement about the following code is true?
        A. It outputs 100 100.
        B. It outputs 100 99.
        C. The output cannot be determined ahead of time.
        D. The code does not compile.
        E. It compiles but throws an exception at runtime.
        F. It compiles but enters an infinite loop at runtime.
        G. None of the above
        
     The code compiles and runs without throwing an exception or entering an infinite loop, so options
    D, E, and F are incorrect. The key here is that the increment operator ++ is not atomic.
    While the first part of the output will always be 100, the second part is nondeterministic.
    It could output any value from 1 to 100, because the threads can overwrite each otherâ€™s work.
    Therefore, option C is the correct answer, and options A and B are incorrect.
