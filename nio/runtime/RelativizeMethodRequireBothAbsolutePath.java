       The code throws an exception at runtime on line 7, making option F correct.
       Remember, when using relativize(), both paths must be absolute or both relativeâ€”the two types cannot be mixed.
       For this reason, option F is correct.
       Note that if the last line were changed to use the absolute path /zoo, the answer would be option A since the path from /zoo/elephant to /zoo is the .. path symbol.
