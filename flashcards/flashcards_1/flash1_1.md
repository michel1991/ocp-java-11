### Why is not recommended to modify a loop variable in the body of the loop?

### In which situations does the compiler refrain from or report an error trying to insert a default no-argument constructor?
If the class has at least one constructor declared, the compiler will not insert one.
It will also throw an error trying to insert one if the parent class does not define a no-argument constructor for the implicit super() call.

### True or false? In Java, = and == can both be used to test equality.
False. Only == is a test for equality; as = is the assignment operator.

### What is the command line to run the program contained in Wolf.class?
```ssh
java Wolf
```

### List the order of class and instance initialization within a single class.
static variables declarations, static initializers, instance variable declarations, instance initializers, constructors

### Which are immutable: String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, arrays, or ArrayList?
String is the only immutable class in the list.

### What is the command line used to compile the Java class Wolf.java, and what file does it generate?
```ssh
Run: javac Wolf.java (and it generates Wolf.class)
