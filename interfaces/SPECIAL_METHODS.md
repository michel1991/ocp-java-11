### What does the following print? Which of the following are the best reasons for creating a private interface method? (Choose two.)

*  A. Add backward compatibility to existing interfaces.
*  B. Provide an implementation that a class implementing the interface can override.
*  C. Increase code reuse within the interface.
*  D. Allow interface methods to be inherited.
*  E. Improve encapsulation of the interface.
*  F. Allow static methods to access instance methods.

Options A and B are incorrect and describe properties of default interface methods.
Option C is correct and one of the primary reasons to add a private interface method.
Option D is not a property of private interface methods.
Option E is also correct, as private interface methods are not exposed to classes implementing the interface.
Option F is a nonsensical statement.
