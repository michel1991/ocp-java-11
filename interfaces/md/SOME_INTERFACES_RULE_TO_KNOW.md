### Which of the following statements about the Callable call() and Runnable run() methods are correct? (Choose all that apply.)
*  A. Both can throw unchecked exceptions.
*  B. Callable takes a generic method argument.
*  C. Callable can throw a checked exception.
*  D. Both can be implemented with lambda expressions.
*  E. Runnable returns a generic type.
*  F. Callable returns a generic type.
*  G. Both methods return void.

All methods are capable of throwing unchecked exceptions, so option A is correct.
Runnable and Callable statements both do not take any arguments, so option B is incorrect.
Only Callable is capable of throwing checked exceptions, so option C is also correct.
Both Runnable and Callable are functional interfaces
that can be implemented with a lambda expression, so option D is also correct.
Finally, Runnable returns void and Callable returns a generic type,
making option F correct and making options E and G incorrect.
