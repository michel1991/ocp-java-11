# Given a public static interface method, what is the best reason to modify it to be private?
A. Reduces code duplication
B. Backward compatibility
C. Improves encapsulation
D. Polymorphism
E. Supports overloaded operators

The primary reason to make any public method private is to improve encapsulation, making option B the correct answer.
Option A is a close second choice, as it is one of the reasons to use private interface methods, but that applies only when adding a new method.
If the method already exists, making it private does not reduce code duplication. The rest of the options do not apply to private interface methods.
