#### Which of the following properties of an enum can be marked abstract?
*  A. The enum type definition
*  B. An enum method
*  C. An enum value
*  D. An enum constructor
*  E. None of the above

Which of the following are advantages of using enumerated types in Java,
rather than static constant values? (Choose three.)

##### Which of the following are advantages of using enumerated types in Java, rather than static constant values? (Choose three.)
* A. Improve performance.
* B. Provide access to fixed set of constants whose values do not change during the course of the application.
* C. Provide a caller with a list of available values for a parameter within a method.
* D. Ensure consistency of data across an application.
* E. Add support for concurrency.
* F. Offer ability to create new enumerated values at runtime.

Enumerated types support creating a set of reusable values whose values are fixed
and consistent across the entire application. For these reasons, options B and D are correct,
and option F is incorrect. Option C is also correct,
as it provides callers of a method with a list of acceptable values.
Finally, options A and E are incorrect.
Using an enum does not, by itself, improve performance or support concurrency.
