/**
   Consider the following code:
   
   Which of the following options is/are valid example(s) of overriding?
   
   A. protected void setF(float f1){ this.f = 2*f1; }
      protected is less restrictive than default, so it is valid.
      
   B.  public void setF(double f1){ this.f = (float) 2*f1; }
      Since the parameter type is different, it is overloading not overriding.
      
   C. public void setF(float f1){ this.f = 2*f1; }
      public is less restrictive than default, so it is valid.
      
   D. private void setF(float f1){ this.f = 2*f1; }
      private is more restrictive than default, so it is NOT valid.
      
   E. float setF(float f1){ this.f = 2*f1; return f;}
      return types must match.
      
    -----------------
    An overriding method can be made less restrictive than the overridden method. The restrictiveness of access modifiers is as follows:
      private>default>protected>public (where private is most restrictive and public is least restrictive).
      
      Note that there is no modifier named default. The absence of any access modifiers implies default access.
