 * What will be the output of the following program ?
    A. It will throw an exception at run time.
    B. It will print IOR
    C. It will print URL://IOR
    D. It will not compile.
    E. None of the above.
    
    Observe that method startUp(String s) of CorbaComponent is overridden by the subclass OrderManager.
    
    When an object of class OrderManager is constructed, the default no args constructor of CorbaComponent is called.
    This constructor calls the startUp(String s) with "IOR" as parameter.
    Now, there are two eligible methods which can be called - CorbaComponent's startUp and OrderManager's startUp.
    
    The method selection is done on the basis of the actual class of the object (which is OrderManager here).
    So, OrderManager's startUp is called, which sets the ior variable to URL://IOR.
    
    Unlike instance method selection, variable (and static method) selection is done on the basis
    of the declared class of the variable and not on the actual class of object that it is referring to.
    
    Correct(C)
