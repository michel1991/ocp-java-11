/**
   Identify correct statement about the following code -
   
    A. It will compile and print 10 when run.
    B. It will fail to compile due to line marked //1.
    C. It will fail to compile due to line marked //2.
    D. It will compile but will throw a NullPointerException at line marked //2.
    -----------
    
    This code pits the precedence of the cast operator and the dot operator against each other.
    In Java, the dot operator has higher precedence than the cast operator.
    That is why, while evaluating (X) y.val, y.val is evaluated first.
    This returns the val variable defined in class Y, which is of type Y. Since Y extends X, it is ok to cast y.val to X.
    However, you can't assign an object of type X to an variable of type int.
    Therefore, the compiler generates an error message saying, error: incompatible types: X cannot be converted to int.
        
        Had the cast operator had higher precedence than the dot operator, y would have been cast to X first.
        ((X)y).val would then have evaluated to X's val, which is of type int. Thus, k would have been assigned the value 10.

class X{
    int val = 10;

    Y val = null; //1
    }
    
    public class TestClass extends X{
    
      public static void main(String[] args){
        Y y = new Y();
        int k = (X) y.val ; //2
        System.out.println(k);
    
      }
