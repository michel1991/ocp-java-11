/**
* Trick questionâ€”the code does not compile! The Spirit class is marked final,
* so it cannot be extended. The main() method uses an anonymous inner class that inherits from Spirit,
* which is not allowed. If Spirit was not marked final, then options C and F would be correct.
* Option A would print Booo!!!, while options B, D, and E would not compile for various reasons.
