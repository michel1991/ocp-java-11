   ---------
   Correct(D)
   Always remember: Instance methods are overridden and variables (and static methods) are hidden.
   Which instance method is invoked depends on the class of the actual object, while which field (and static method)
   is accessed depends on the class of the variable.

    Here, b refers to an object of class Beta so b.getH() will always call the overridden (subclass's method).
    However, the type of reference of b is Baap. so b.h will always refer to Baap's h.

    Further, inside Beta's getH(), Beta's h will be accessed instead of Baap's h because
    you are accessing this.h ('this' is implicit) and the type of this is Beta.

        System.out.println("Baap " + h);
