 * What will be the result of attempting to compile and run class B?
    A. It will not compile.
    B. It will print 10 and then 10
    C. It will print 20 and then 20
    D. It will print 10 and then 20
    E. It will print 20 and then 10
    
   Correct(E)
    Note that a final variable can be hidden. Here, although fi in A is final, it is hidden by fi of B. So b.fi = 20; is valid since B's fi is not final.
